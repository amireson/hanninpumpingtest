    "A solution to the steady-state drawdown (cone of depression) in an unconfined aquifer was derived by Theim - the \"Theim solution\". Consider the diagram below. $b$ represents the saturated thickness. Prior to pumping, the water table is at the static water level, and the saturated thickness is $b_0$ (m). We can work out $b_0$ if we know the depth to the base of the aquifer (in our case the base of the sand) from drillers logs, and we know the depth below ground of the water table before pumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the aquifer is pumped for some period of time, with the pump still running, we should check whether or not the water table has stopped changing. Once we are convinced that the water table is not changing, we can be satisfied that we have reached steady conditions, and that this Theim method of analysis is appropriate.\n",

    "where $K$ is hydraulic conductivity (m/min), $Q$ is pumping rate (m$^3$/min), $b_1$ is a known saturated thickness at distance $r_1$ (which could be one known point on the cone of depression). Changing $K$ changes the steepness of the cone of depression. The above equation can be used to simulate the aquifer thickness, or the equivalent drawdown, and compared with observed drawdown values. \n",
